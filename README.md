# microwave sensor with capacitor
* Objective: to enlarge h-field sensing area
* This sensor was simulated using CST Microwave Studio
* suggestion material under test(MUT) for h-field sensing area: magneto-dielectric material
* To enlarge the localized H zone, I consider the capacitor structure at the area of permeability sensing area.
* Figure:
